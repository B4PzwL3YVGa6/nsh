nsh//network config shell//Chris Cappuccio <chris@dqc.org> version 20020412

A CLI intended for OpenBSD-based routers running little except for sshd,
targeted towards CompactFlash-based Soekris Net4501 and similar embedded
units.  The idea is to allow simple, quick management of a router *without*
requiring the user to be familiar with ifconfig, route, netstat, pfctl,
and the various configuration files in /etc which are otherwise required to
manage this type of router (In fact, we eliminate the use of those
commands and /etc configuration files entirely!).  In conjunction with the
OpenBSD kernel, sshd, and maybe snmpd you have a fully functioning system.

(nsh is BSD-licensed, with much code re-used from OpenBSD userland)

nsh handles the following functions:

* Gives the user a command-line interface to:
  + Add/delete/show/flush/monitor IP routes
  + Configure interfaces for IP, MTU, VLAN
  + Show host (IP, TCP, UDP) and router statistics
  + Configure PF/NAT on an interface
  + Configure the ALTQ tbr on an interface
  + Save the current routes, interface configs to a file
* This shell replaces most of /etc/rc, /etc/netstart on an embedded system,
  simply started as nsh -i, it will read the previously saved configuration
  into the system, setting up the IP configuration for future use.
* Nsh can start as a user shell from ssh, or console.  Allows privileged user
  to escape to bourne shell (for now anyways..)
