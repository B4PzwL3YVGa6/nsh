This code in its current state is nowhere near complete in meeting
its original goals.  Thus, it is a work in progress, future versions
will be released soon which implement much of the following:

Cleanup:

* All printf newlines should be \r\n, I think ?  Or will ssh take care of
  this distinction ??? Make them all consistent in any event...
  (And what about perror?)
* Probably don't need to be using fprintf(stderr,...) anywhere, since
  this is supposed to be a 'router' not really a unix environment
  so far as user is concerned ?? Replace perror with non-FILENO_STDERR func?
* Finish up externs.h 
* And more stylistic cleanup...

Required for intended functionality:

* Add 'save' command which will read routes, hostname, interface configurations
  and write them to a configuration file which can be read by cmdrc on
  startup with -i (requires the following to be done _first_:)
* Add a command which will configure interface IPs, vlans, and maybe media
  types
* Add a command which will add routes

PF (required):

* Allow simple block in all/pass out all keep state pf rules to be setup for
  interfaces (default modulate state?)
* Allow simple nat pf rules to be setup for interfaces
* Allow nat rdrs to be setup
* Allow pf holes to be setup
* Do we want a more sophisticated interface into pf or just let the user
  shell out to use pfctl?
* To handle pf on 'save' .... Only save rules that are simple enough to be
  represented by what we can setup for now.

Cute features:

* Perhaps some way for the shell to upgrade itself when given a network source
  for a new binary? 
* Hooks for a web interface?
* Add more diagnostic messages for verbose output where useful
* Do we hook into snmpd at all or just run it separately on the same box?
* Do we build in a simple ping, traceroute or just shell out for these??
* And what about telnet/ssh (maybe shell out for ssh and ignore telnet)??
* ALTQ RED/CBQ/HFSC

Future:

* BGP, OSPF?? Steal from gated(BSDlic)? Or hooks to integrate zebra(GPL)?
* IPv6?? (shouldn't be hard, considering that most of the functions
  we stole from other source already support it)
* IPsec! Configure VPNs with simple CLI commands-isakmpd has a fifo interface
* IPcomp...
* IPIP? GRE?? Tunnels??
* IPX?? AppleTalk??
