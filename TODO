This it is a work in progress, future versions will be released which
implement much of the following:

Cleanup:

* Finish up externs.h 
* ...

Required for intended functionality:

* Finish 'save' command which will write routes, hostname, and the interface
  configurations to a file which can be read by cmdrc on
  startup with -i (requires the following to be done _first_:)
* Finish up interface mode handler commands
* Create a bridge mode handler
* Create pf commands under interface, generic mode handler:

* Allow simple block in all/pass out all keep state pf rules to be setup for
  interfaces (default modulate state?)
* Allow simple nat pf rules to be setup for interfaces
* Allow nat rdrs to be setup
* Allow pf holes to be setup
* Do we want a more sophisticated interface into pf or just let the user
  shell out to use pfctl?
* To handle pf on 'save' .... Only save rules that are simple enough to be
  represented by what we can setup for now.

Cute features:

* Perhaps some way for the shell to upgrade itself when given a network source
  for a new binary? 
* Hooks for a web interface?
* Add more diagnostic messages for verbose output where useful
* Can we hook into snmpd at all or just run it separately on the same box?
* Do we build in a simple ping, traceroute or just shell out for these??
* And what about telnet/ssh (maybe shell out for ssh and ignore telnet)??
* ALTQ RED/CBQ/HFSC
* Support for paging through displays of text X lines at a time
* Something comparable to "| inc" from cisco-land
* Tab command, argument completion

Future:

* BGP, OSPF?? Steal from gated(BSDlic)? Or hooks to integrate zebra(GPL)?
* IPv6?? (shouldn't be hard, considering that most of the functions
  we stole from other source already support it)
* IPsec! Configure VPNs with simple CLI commands-isakmpd has a fifo interface
* IPComp...
* IPIP/GRE?? Other tunnels??
* IPX?? AppleTalk??
