$nsh: TODO,v 1.35 2012/05/21 01:03:31 chris Exp $

nsh is a work in progress, diffs are welcome

Cleanup:

* Formatting for the manual.  Something that looks slick in PDF and print.
* More security auditing for string handling, off-by-one errors, data
  passed to kernel, data passed elsewhere...
* Sanity check _before_ args hit int*() routines, based on some framework
  of possible values for each function (something that works along with
  context sensitive help framework)
* Push more argument validation up, outside of the actual function routines
* Consistent return values between functions?
* Support new wireless information interfaces where necessary
* Use sockaddr everywhere, instead of home-grown ip_t

To be implemented:

* rdomain/rtable control in more places
* handle newer bridge commands
* handle newer 802.11 gunk like rssi display, chan, flags
* handle kernel pppoe
* privsep (imsg based?)
* copy configs from/to tftp/ftp/http/other parts of filesystem/etc
* support adding routes, ping, traceroute, ssh, telnet in alternate rdomains
* RSA certificate generation/management method (isakmpd, iked, possibly sshd)
* Persistent comments/remarks in the config file (to document routes, etc..)
* IPv6 (mostly there already, but I won't finish it properly until I use IPv6
  myself or someone else submits patches)
* Support for paging through displays of text X lines at a time
* Something comparable to "| inc" from cisco-land
* Context-sensitive help

Would be nice:

* Perhaps some way for the shell to upgrade itself, or the entire system/
  flash image when given a network source for new binaries?
* Build a simple web interface that works through the rc file handler (web if
  that calls nsh -i to execute commands)
* Add more diagnostic messages for verbose output where useful
* Convenient/automatic mechanisms to centralize configurations for
  tracking/revision control

Known Bugs (or, things that I don't want to bother with right now, but
better not forget later...):

* The kernel does not keep count of information displayed in 'show rtstat'
  properly (what else??)
* ALTQTBRSET was removed from the kernel with the migration to pf.  But,
  there is no easy to use equivalent.  Fix this.
* The kernel/wireless drivers do not use txpower data in any way.  Also
  TXPOWER_AUTO does absolutely nothing and is not even tracked in the kernel.
* ...
